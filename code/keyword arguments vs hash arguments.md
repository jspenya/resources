### keyword arguments started in Ruby 2.0 so older versions do not cater to them


## keyword arguments:
- there will be an error if there is a typo in the passed keyword argument
- can specify defaults easily
- there is a clear declaration of what a method takes in as arguments (method signature)

## hash arguments:
- you can freely add extra values as it isn't strict in which arguments it takes in
- indifferent to strings & symbols keys in the passed hash arguments
- can use reserved ruby keywords like 'class' or 'def' (but I still don't see it's good practice to use these anywhere)
